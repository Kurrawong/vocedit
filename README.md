# VocEdit

VocEdit is a versatile and user-friendly webform tool for creating and editing controlled vocabularies based on the [VocPub Profile of SKOS](https://w3id.org/profile/vocpub). It empowers users to design, manage, and organize both flat and hierarchical concept structures within vocabularies. With straightforward save and load functionality, VocEdit integrates seamlessly with the local filesystem, making it easy to maintain vocabulary files directly on your device without you having to dive into the underlying technical data.

This tool is available for use online at https://vocedit.dev.kurrawong.ai.
